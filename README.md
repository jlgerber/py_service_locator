# ServiceLocator
This is a simple implementation of a service locator, inspired by the need for an alternative IoC pattern to simple dependency injection via class __init__s. While I like IoC and recognize that DependencyInjection has a lot going for it when used in a strongly typed language, in Python, it can easily lead to hard-to-follow code  - a lot of intermediate classes passing dependencies through construction without clear interfaces. Having to trace dependencies around to understand intent is not fun. And it feels antithetical to the whole point of SOLID, which is to facilitate . yuck.

So, here is an alternative. Register dependencies with the service locator in your main enthrpoint.
